## **Cell Density Quantification of High-Resolution Nissl Images of the Juvenile Rat Brain**

        <p>Nissl histology underpins our understanding of brain anatomy and architecture. Despite its importance, no high-resolution datasets are currently available in the literature for 14-day-old rats. To remedy this issue, we have acquired over 2000 high-resolution images (0.346 Î¼m per pixel) from eight juvenile rat brains stained with cresyl violet. Working with a team of neuroscientists, I developed a machine learning solution to automate the cell density quantification process, significantly improving its efficiency and reliability. This pipeline was applied to the primary somatosensory hindlimb (S1HL) cortical column and expanded using manual and ML-based cortical layer annotations.</p>
